Django-Bootstrap
================

The quickest way to get started with Django.


This is my response to a thread on django-developers regarding default project layout http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/2b88ddc6dd68ed6

It started out as a gist https://gist.github.com/1007579. But even I couldn't find it by searching for "django bootstrap". So, I figured it wasn't helping anyone else either.

Usage:
------
    django-bootstrap [app_name] [project_name] [virtualenv_path/name] [admin_name (default=admin)] [admin_password (default=admin)]
